# Setup
(Note: currently you can only use EPM via a CLI on Linux.)

Run this on your terminal:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophb-ccjt/epm/refs/heads/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

or, if you want missing packages to be automatically installed, run this: 
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophb-ccjt/epm/refs/heads/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo bash ./setup.sh
```

This should create an `epm.sh` file and `EPM` directory.
