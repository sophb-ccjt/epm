# Setup

**Note:** EPM currently only works via CLI on Linux. More platform support is coming soon.

Run this on your terminal:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophb-ccjt/epm/refs/heads/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
# Run normally, or with sudo to allow missing packages to be installed
./setup.sh      # or sudo ./setup.sh
```

This should create an `epm.sh` file and `EPM` directory.
